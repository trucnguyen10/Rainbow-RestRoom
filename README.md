# Rainbow-RestRoom
This is build for a hackathon. Rainbow Restroom is a website that lets students living on campus to find the nearest restroom on their campus
including those with and without menstrual products. To make the user experience better, we also let students rate and comment on the condition 
of the restroom. By doing this, we are not only tracking the cleanliness, but we are also letting people from the non-binary community find their
Safe Zone, where they can receive the respect of nearby people. Track and update the availability of menstrual supplies, and donate menstrual products
to the location.
