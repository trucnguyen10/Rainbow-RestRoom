**GENDER-NEUTRAL RESTROOM PERSPECTIVE** 🚽
Was born in Asian countries where non-binary individuals and people from the LGBTQ+ community have limited restroom choices, they will need to think about which room is suitable for either themselves or the community. I appreciate how gender-neutral restrooms are normalized in the US, which means there are more space and privacy for everyone regardless of their gender identity and representation. Therefore, I built Rainbow Restroom for many purposes. On the one hand, I want to help students on college campuses to find restroom locations that are convenient for them. On the other hand, by building this website I hope to push for more gender-neutral restrooms everywhere, so that people of all genders could feel safe in their everyday lives.

**MENSTRUAL SUPPLIES**🩸


As a female student, I understand the need for menstrual supplies around campus because it would be a painful experience if we don't have access to menstrual products when we need them. Hence, I decided to include in our website a way to help students find restrooms with free menstrual supplies on their campus. My purpose is to alleviate menstrual poverty and create an ecosystem where students who menstruate don't have to worry about access to menstrual products - where they get help and help other people nearby through the donate function.

**PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES** 🦽


There is a good sign that almost all campuses have an accessible entrance where people with disabilities can easily go inside the building. To build a stronger community, I help the universities to inform people with accessible entrances to make their life more convenient.

⚙️ **What it does**


Rainbow Restroom is a website that lets students living on campus to find the nearest restroom on their campus including those with and without menstrual products. To make the user experience better, we also let students rate and comment on the condition of the restroom. By doing this, we are not only tracking the cleanliness, but we are also letting people from the non-binary community find their Safe Zone, where they can receive the respect of nearby people. Track and update the availability of menstrual supplies, and donate menstrual products to the location.

💻 **Features**

➡️ 🩸 Donate menstrual supplies.

➡️ ⭐ Rating and Review system for restrooms.

**An overview of the functions of the website is as below:**

1. Search and find restrooms filtered by campus. In this project, I am focusing on 2 universities campuses ( DePauw University and Tufts University )

2. Search and find a location with menstrual supplies - filter campus which menstrual products are available (pads, tampons, cups, lines, etc).

3. Search and find accessible entrances for people with disabilities filtered by campus

4. Submit a restroom, let students report a new location, and updated it to the map after checking. ( This can do either by form or by chatbot)

5. Rating System, let students rate and comment on the restroom to give other users an overview of the restroom before using.

6. Donate system, let other people nearby donate the menstrual products to the restroom to help other individuals who menstruate.

🔧 **How we built it**

I designed a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

I had also applied Google Cloud to create a chatbot using Dialogflow that allows users to chat with the system to report a new restroom on campus. The data received from the user will be stored in the database in realtime.

We used Google Maps API to customize the campus's map and pin the location that is useful for the users.

📲 **What's next for Rainbow Restroom 📲**
➡️ I will try to add more university campuses to our database.

➡️ I will not only target college campuses but also cities on the East Coast.

➡️ I will work on our website to improve its UI/UX.
